# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

# process 1
even_num = 0

for num in range(1,101):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_num += num
print(even_num)   

# process 2 [only with loop]

even_num = 0
for num in range(2, 101, 2):
    even_num += num
print(even_num)
