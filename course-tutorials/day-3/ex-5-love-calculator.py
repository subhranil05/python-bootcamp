# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 

# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
final_name = name1 + name2 
lower_case =  final_name.lower()

t = lower_case.count("t")
r = lower_case.count("r")
u = lower_case.count("u")
e = lower_case.count("e")

true = t + r + u + e

l = lower_case.count("l")
o = lower_case.count("o")
v = lower_case.count("v")
e = lower_case.count("e")

love = l + o + v + e

score = str(true) + str(love)
final_score = int(score)

if final_score < 10 or final_score > 90:
    print(f"Your score is {final_score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")

elif final_score > 40 and final_score < 50:
    print(f"Your score is {final_score}, you are alright together.")

else:
    print(f"Your score is {final_score}.")
