# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 

# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

e = lower_case.count("e")
